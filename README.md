- 👋 Hi, I’m @GlitchKraft
- 👀 I’m interested in navigating the forest of code
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, HTML5, CSS, Kotlin, 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the creation of small desktop and web apps for developers; that can run offline and have an IDE intergrated within it.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
